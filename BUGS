*1104 (integrity check)
 **reporter: anonymous
 **date: 2005-08-22
 **message: I'm receiving a lot of messages from the integrity check
            daemon related to modifications on /etc/resolv.conf..
            I'm using DHCP and even when the md5sum does not change,
            the c_time is changed and an alert generated.
 **resolution: For v0.3, I'm going to add a supress flag to avoid
               receiving repeated alerts like this. For now, I realize
               that adding the st_ctime to the checksum is useless. 
               Removing it will stop these unecessary alerts.

*1103 (analysis_stats)
 **reporter: anonymous
 **date: 2005-08-22
 **message: Stats are bogus. Looking at the code, I  see that gethour
            is not correct.
 **resolution: The stats was comparing the maximum and minimum number
               of events against the wrong threshold value. Fixed gethour
               to do it right :)

*1102 (analysis server)

 **message: Every SSH login error message is being notified twice.
            I receive two emails with the same message. 
            -- CUT --
 **resolution: The problem is that SSH forks and create a uniq process
               to handle a new client requests. When the login fails,
               both processes are logging to syslog. This is the reason
               why you are seeing two messages every time. I added
               some checkings to avoid notifying on repeated messages.

*1101 (os_regex)
 **reporter: anonymous
 **date: 2005-Jul-25
 **message: Rule "su\S*: BAD su" is not matching the log entry
            "su: BAD SU dcid to root on /dev/ttyp0". If I change
            the regex to "su: BAD su" it works.
 **resolution: Bug on the os_regex. When the first pattern after
               a "\X*" matched the next character, it would be
               ignored. Fixed the library.
